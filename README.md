# Dismoi - Web Extension

[![Build Status](https://semaphoreci.com/api/v1/projects/02861938-a833-4f0e-938d-9bb2cd5ae49f/965710/shields_badge.svg)](https://semaphoreci.com/bmenant_lmem/extension)

At its early stages, this software was a fork of [Crossbuilder](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/crossbuilder).
However, the software has evolved to better embrace our project needs and specificities.
As a result, the upstream codebase haven’t be merged for a while and it is unlikely to happen ever again.

## Structure

- `src/app/`: React application (will be imported in the apps bellow).
- `src/assets/`: web app fonts, images, etc.
- `src/lib/`: external _non npm_ modules.
- `manifest/`: base and environment specific web-extension manifests.
- `test/app/`: tests for Redux actions and reducers, and for React components (using [enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/)).
- `test/integration/`: runtime tests for built web-extensions.

## Installation

First install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) (optional).

```bash
# git clone...
nvm use lts/carbon
yarn
```

### Sentry

To configure Sentry error reporting, you should create a `.sentryclirc` file at the root of the project directory:

```
[defaults]
project=web-extension
org=lmem

[auth]
token=4d786d88c7d9436282c35b4eb82ae2dfeaff5ee296e3404ba3654ab62c151b73
```

> **Note 1:** You'll find your token here https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/

> **Note 2:** If you ever need to change the Sentry DSN go to `./webpack/config.plugins.js`.

## Environments

Environment variables are taken from multiple `.env` files.

From highest to lowest priority:
- `.env.${NODE_ENV}.local`
- `.env.${NODE_ENV}`
- `.env.local`
- `.env`

In development you should create a copy of `.env.development.example` to `.env.development` and adjust the values.
To run automation, create a copy of `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust values.

> **Note:** The test environment ignores local files.

> **Note 2:** This configuration was inspired by [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/env.html#%F0%9F%8C%B3-variables-d'environnement)  

List of environments:
- `staging` : staging extension on `staging` API
- `proding` : staging extension on `production` API
- `production`: production ready extension on `production` API

You can build any variations of the extension by playing with environment variables and this `webpack` command:
```
NODE_ENV=production|proding|staging webpack --mode=production --env.PLATFORM=firefox|chromium --env.SENTRY_ENABLED
```

## Development

```bash
# watch files change (do not reload the extension though)
# start Webpack Dev Server
yarn start
```

```bash
# watch files change (do not reload the extension though)
# start Webpack Dev Server with production content
yarn start:productionApi
```

- [Load unpacked extension's `./build/dev/` folder to Chrome.](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked)


## Deployment

> For each `feature`, `fix`, etc... we create a new branch and then a PR with `master` as the target branch. 

Once the PR is merged into `master` a build is triggered on [SemaphoreCI](https://semaphoreci.com/lmem/extension/)
> see [build configuration](https://semaphoreci.com/lmem/extension/settings)

### Staging
Once the build passes, an automatic deploy to `staging` "server" is triggered. 
Roughly, this deploy process bumps the version number in `package.json` and build each packages for each **platform** and each **environment**:

Once built each package is released on [Github](https://github.com/insitu-project/recommendations-webextension/releases) and on both stores as `unlisted` version.
> The publication on the Chrome store may take a while -- days -- to be validated.

> See the detailed `staging` deploy steps `./release.config.staging.js` in project root directory.

### Production
The `production` deployment process is manual, and is triggered once the staging has been functionally validated.

> See the detailed deploy steps `./release.config.staging.js` in project root directory.

Make you sure have access to semaphore and wait until the last master built is completed with success:
https://semaphoreci.com/lmem/extension/branches/master

 - Then click on the last master build and click "Deploy manually".
 - Tick `production` checkbox

## Notes / FAQ

The **feat** flag, in the commit, forces `semantic-release`, to increment the minor version number of the future production release.

## Storybook

There is a Storybook for components design, exploration, testing and documentation. It's hot reloaded.
Storybook may be run with the following command:

```bash
yarn storybook
```

It also possible to build a static version, the one you can see here : https://storybook.lmem.net.

You can do this with:

```bash
yarn build-storybook
```

It is automatically deployed to https://storybook.lmem.net on every `develop` branch update.

### Conventional Commits

We follow [conventional commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) since version 1.0.0 and
we use [Semantic Release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) to build and publish new releases.

### Redux DevTools

We use [Redux DevTools](https://extension.remotedev.io/) to inspect Redux actions and state changes.
Once installed, from the Redux DevTools extension’s context menu, choose “Open Remote DevTools” for remote monitoring.

## Build Web extension

### Production

To build all production packages (Chromium, Firefox, etc).

```bash
# build files to './build/{browser}/'
yarn build:production
```

### Staging

To build a staging package...

```bash
# build files to './build/staging/'
yarn build:staging
```

### Development

```bash
# build files to './build/dev/'
yarn build:dev
```

## Test

```bash
# test everything
yarn test
```

## Lint

You can lint both TypeScript and CSS by running:

```bash
yarn lint
```

### TypeScript

Code style rules are available in `tslint.json`.

You can manually lint .ts files running the following command:

```bash
yarn lint:ts
```

### Styles

Styling rules are available in `.stylelintrc`.

You can manually the styled components running the following command:

```bash
yarn lint:css
```

### Integration tests

Inspect the extension _background_ to get its console and run `window.integrationTest()`.
