# Bulle.io - Web Extension

[![Build Status](https://semaphoreci.com/api/v1/projects/02861938-a833-4f0e-938d-9bb2cd5ae49f/965710/shields_badge.svg)](https://semaphoreci.com/bmenant_lmem/extension)

At its early stages, this software was a fork of [Crossbuilder](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/crossbuilder).
However, the software has evolved to better embrace our project needs and specificities.
As a result, the upstream codebase haven’t be merged for a while and it is unlikely to happen ever again.

## Structure

- `src/app/`: React application (will be imported in the apps bellow).
- `src/assets/`: web app fonts, images, etc.
- `src/lib/`: external _non npm_ modules.
- `manifest/`: base and environment specific web-extension manifests.
- `test/app/`: tests for Redux actions and reducers, and for React components (using [enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/)).
- `test/integration/`: runtime tests for built web-extensions.

## Installation

First install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) (optional).

```bash
# git clone...
nvm use lts/carbon
yarn
```

## Development

```bash
# watch files change (do not reload the extension though)
# start Webpack Dev Server
yarn start
```

- [Load unpacked extension's `./build/dev/` folder to Chrome.](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked)

## Storybook

There is a Storybook for components design, exploration, testing and documentation. It's hot reloaded.
Storybook may be run with the following command:

```bash
yarn storybook
```

It also possible to build a static version, the one you can see here : https://storybook.lmem.net.

You can do this with:

```bash
yarn build-storybook
```

It is automatically deployed to https://storybook.lmem.net on every `develop` branch update.

### Conventional Commits

We follow [conventional commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) since version 1.0.0 and
we use [Semantic Release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) to build and publish new releases.

### Redux DevTools

We use [Redux DevTools](https://extension.remotedev.io/) to inspect Redux actions and state changes.
Once installed, from the Redux DevTools extension’s context menu, choose “Open Remote DevTools” for remote monitoring.
